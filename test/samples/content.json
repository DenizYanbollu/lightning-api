Hive is good and all, but the growth is \"slow\" to some extend (not talking price) but also relatively \"stable\" with the 10% APR and 10% APY on HBD.\n\nSo ye. I pulled a some liquid Hive and I also ended up withdrawing my 100 HBD to Binance where I put it into different coins.\n\nI only have a small amount in each coin and I just plan on HODL this to see if it can amount to anything.\n\n<center>These are the coins.</center>\n\n\n![Bcoins.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/cwow2/23t8CSPFCNLG2X2sJTSRjcm61T2e6LfByJRf5GSs6BGupBLAk8YRT4KWRurhAJGVCqbMe.png)\n\nI might want to be a SHIB INU millionaire, since it doesn't take that much haha xD",
