    "body": "<center>![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmdQRwckyKdSfxehCwUzsiJEmaWfDVEdhgGh3ic3x4RyXi/image.png)</center>\n\n<div class=\"text-justify\">\n\nI don't have the full story, however, I have stumbled upon a couple of posts about VCs and LPs taking over web3 and the metaverse (I think this was stirred up by Jack's [tweet](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?t=a6Ifv_XQzW-RQ2CaBWszLw&s=19 ). I even stumbled upon a couple of videos on TikTok from supposed WEB2 and WEB3 experts (yes people are calling themselves that now) about how we should be careful of the gatekeepers and how the tools used to build WEB3 are owned by the gatekeepers.\n\nI find some of these discussions quite ironic considering that no one was talking about WEB3 12 months ago. It was this novelty amongst these small communities of crypto enthusiasts who have been bamboozled and sidelined by influencers when the big bucks started to roll in. Those leading the discussion are not even an integral part of the process (of building WEB 3).  How sad.\n\nNow there are merits to the argument against the gatekeepers but the reality is that most of the development needed to make WEB 3 a reality would be heavily funded by those with deep pockets and those who do have (pockets). We cannot be clamouring for investors on one hand and try to shut them out on the other, there should be some balance.\n\nEven the masses are not prepared for WEB3. They are waiting on the gatekeepers to make their move before they join in which is often too late.\n\n**Early adopters**. One of the major advantages of getting into crypto or WEB3 is that you get the chance of being an early adopter, with little or no entry cost (AIRDROPS). Unfortunately, many do not care about what's been built on WEB3 until it started to make the news, which in my opinion, is a little too late.\n\n**A fork away**. Crypto is playing a huge part in the development of the metaverse/WEB3, thus, it is only reasonable to infer that some of its ethos will apply to WEB3. One of the key ways to settle disputes in the *cryptosphere* is to fork. People/groups can opt-out of the system they do not believe in at little or no cost.\n\nFor instance, the Steem hostile takeover featured the Steem community versus the former CEO of Tron, Justin Sun. The community was able to break away from the steem blockchain after it realized that its plans and vision did not align with that of Sun, which led to the birth of Hive. This blockchain has surpassed steem in almost every department in the space of two years.\n\nThis is just a typical example of the power of the community and why I do not think LPs and VCs will take over this place. They can either play fair or catch everyone’s bags.\n\nIn conclusion, the hallmark of WEB3 is decentralization. Thus, there is no monopolizing the system. You can either be facilitators or contributors. This is my simplistic view on the issue of VCs and LPs taking over the cryptosphere/metaverse/WEB3.\n\n***\n[Image Source](https://pixabay.com/images/search/%20network/)\n***\n\nIf you are new on *hive* and you are looking for more exposure I will suggest you check out the *Proof of Blind project*.
