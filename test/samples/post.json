Poverty level varies in countries and we can take exchange rate to the USD into consideration as when looking at levels of poverty geographically\n\nWhile working away in Rustenburg, I spent $4.8 per day on meals which includes breakfast, lunch and supper and that was really being economical so I don't end up working for food alone because I barely spend $2.50 per day when at home and having to go know where. \nSo looking at living under $1.90 per day, one can imagine how bad it is to be in living in such state. \n\n![Updated estimates of the impact of COVID19 on global poverty_ Turning the corner on the pandemic in 2021_  Brave 4_5_2022 3_34_53 PM.png](https://i.imgur.com/7eTVjjP.png)\n[Source ](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty-turning-corner-pandemic-2021)\n\nThe above graph shows reduction in extreme poverty level between 2015-2019 with Covid 19 pushing poverty level back to 700 million region in from 2019 to present. \n\n![Updated estimates of the impact of COVID19 on global poverty_ Turning the corner on the pandemic in 2021_  Brave 4_5_2022 3_42_36 PM.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOw3Pz8.png)\n[Source](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty-turning-corner-pandemic-2021)\n\nA curious look on Africa tells a different story, its extreme poverty level keeps increasing compared to the global levels. I wouldn't argue the result of poverty level in Africa because it is a continent where its leaders manage to get nothing right. \n\nBasically humans and especially the ones living in poverty levels as well as the middle class are on there own in shrinking the poverty gap. I'd like to think it is possible considering just over a decade ago we have no opportunities like we have today in blockchain technology. \n\nFor the minority of us on here, we are interacting with a tokenized technology and for some part it is engaging with activities one likes, gaming, sharing photos, walking, writing and getting rewarded for it. \nMost of us on Hive reinvest our earnings and move funds from one project to the other consequently compounding our investments with almost zero entry level. \n\nLast month I earned $250 on Hive a continuous effort could see me double and give it a triple effect. \nCreating complete decentralized projects with value is another contribution to shrinking the poverty gap, projects that are not just for solely making profits but revolutionary and possibly in contrast to the traditionally ones with no incentive for usage. \n\nFor the extreme poverty affected, gaining access to internet, smartphone could be a hindrance and this is where I feel we come in to share with those that willing to learn and put in the effort to at least reduce the rate of poverty or give it a shrink. \n\n![4HFqJv9qRjVecs4xkhd5EvhidWEEBnn9tCVDBkBhQpUFvab78MhbU1Vuhsv2nJ2ugLQ4jgoYaT2PVTE1rv7F3KJvnDsHa35tCHLax2ssgUniFSQW5hn3YTimRBRATW8fsxoPk9AY3pXfRonvfdbrEjimyvnEwGLdDed.gif](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/joetunex/23swXhgKFcQfjrRE3RFauGNWYSCD2e7BLuJZocW9sQ9yjMabkMbLqzRF5xFcaShJpBKw2.gif)\n*Gif by @mariosfame*\n\n***We owe it to ourselves to make Hive great***\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/joetunex/KvZG9M7z-image.png)\n*Image by @doze*\n\nPosted Using [LeoFinance <sup>Beta</sup>](https://leofinance.io/@joetunex/shrinking-the-poverty-gap-yes-a-possibility)",
